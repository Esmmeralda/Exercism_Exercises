/*
    Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.
    Darts is a game where players throw darts at a target.

    In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points,
    depending on where the dart lands:
        - If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points)
        - If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point
        - If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
        - If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points

    The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the
    entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.
    Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric
    defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

    Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its Cartesian coordinates x and
    y, where X and Y are REAL), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.
